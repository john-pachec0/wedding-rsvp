## Opt-In Process Description

### How Recipients Provide Consent

Our toll-free number is used exclusively for **guest-initiated, two-way conversational messaging** related to our wedding RSVP process. Recipients provide explicit consent through the following process:

1. **Physical Invitation Distribution**
   - Guests receive a physical invitation card in the mail
   - The card contains our toll-free phone number prominently displayed
   - The invitation is designed as an interactive puzzle that requires texting the number to solve

2. **Guest-Initiated Contact**
   - Guests **voluntarily text our number** with their passcode attempt
   - This initial text message serves as their explicit consent to receive auto-replies
   - **We never send the first message** - all conversations are initiated by the guest

3. **Auto-Reply System**
   - Our system automatically responds to incoming text messages with:
     - Helpful hints if the passcode is incorrect
     - The wedding website password if the passcode is correct
   - All messages are direct responses to guest inquiries

4. **Single-Purpose Communication**
   - Messages are only sent in direct response to guest texts
   - We do not send promotional, marketing, or unsolicited messages
   - Communication is limited to the wedding RSVP puzzle functionality

## Proof of Consent Evidence

### Physical Invitation Card

Our invitation card clearly displays:
- The toll-free phone number
- Instructions indicating guests should text the number
- Context that this is part of the wedding RSVP process

The invitation's design makes it clear that texting the number is:
- Voluntary
- Part of an interactive experience
- Required only if guests wish to RSVP via our website

### Guest-Initiated Workflow

**Step 1:** Guest receives physical invitation in the mail  
**Step 2:** Guest solves puzzle and decides to text the number  
**Step 3:** Guest sends first message (their passcode attempt)  
**Step 4:** System auto-replies with hints or website password  
**Step 5:** Guest may text again if needed (new passcode attempts)

**Key Point:** The guest makes the first contact. We never initiate.

## Sample Message Flow

### Scenario 1: Incorrect Passcode (First Attempt)

**Guest sends:**
```
incorrect passcode
```

**System auto-replies:**
```
Thank you for contacting Faath & Pacheco Mergers & Acquisitions.

We understand you wish to RSVP to our merger ceremony. For verification purposes, please provide the passcode.

The key to access lies within your invitation. Not all numbers serve the same purpose. Some reveal. Others conceal.

Study both sides carefully.

**Guest sends:**
```

```

## Opt-Out Process

Guests can opt-out at any time through any of these methods:

1. **Simply stop texting** - No further messages will be received unless they text again
2. **Text "STOP"** - Standard opt-out keyword (though our system doesn't send unsolicited messages)
3. **Ignore the invitation** - Guests who don't text never receive any messages

**Important:** Since we never initiate contact, guests have inherent opt-out capability by simply not texting us.
